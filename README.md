# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

- Add a button to clear the cart
- Move the cart to the right side, continue using the cards that we made
- Add a button somewhere on the cart items that removes the entire type of item from your cart
- When clicking on an image, display details about the image

We've done the sorts of problems below in JS, but now let's repeat them using Svelte. Use knowledge from previous assignments but implement them in our new Svelte environment.

- Add a `category` field to your items. Add UI that allows the user to filter the catalog by those categories (bonus: do not hardcode the categories when allowing the user to select one to filter by - instead get the list of categories from the data itself)
- Add UI that allows the user to sort the catalog by price and name and also in reverse order.
